An unsupervised learning system for clustering cough sound spectrograms using a custom Convolutional Autoencoder.
This project implements a complete pipeline from data loading, calculating mean and std to clustering evaluation,
specifically written for analyzing different types of cough sounds without requiring labeled data.
